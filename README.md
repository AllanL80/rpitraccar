# rpitraccar
Python based Traccar client for GPS tracking using Raspberry Pi and SIM7600 hat.

This is my "Learning Python" project, I have not touched code in 20+ years so it's ugly, maybe non functional, possibly get you and/or your partner pregnant.

Please feel free to comment, suggest, bag out or use nasty meme's but do it in a kind loving way!

Cheers,

Allan
